Your Current Monthly Payment
Your current monthly payment is $771.00 for June 2019. This amount will
continue unless there is a change in the information we use to determine your
SSI eligibility and payment amount.
Your Back Payments
We explain how we figured the monthly payment amount on the worksheet at
the end of this letter. The explanation shows how your income, other than
any SSI payments, affects your SSI payment.
When You Will Receive Your Payments
Your bank or other financial institution will receive your monthly payment of
$693.90 around June 1, 2019, and on the first of each month after that.
Information About Your SSI Payments
As we told you before, we are withholding part of your payment to get
back money you were overpaid. Starting June 2019, we will start
withholding $77.10. Therefore, you will receive a payment for $693.90
instead of $771.00.
The $77.10 we will withhold is 10 percent of your SSI money plus any
other money we use in figuring your SSI. If you want us to withhold
more or less, please call or visit your Social Security office.
Information Used To Determine Your Payments
We based the decision on these facts:
You meet all the rules to be eligible for SSI beginning May 2, 2019.
Our rules do not allow us to pay SSI until the month after you first
meet all of our eligibility rules. Therefore, the first month we can pay
you is June 2019.
You were found disabled on May 2, 2019.
SSI is a Federal program. However, some States give us money to add
to the SSI payments. When you are eligible for SSI, payments may
include Federal money, State money, or both.
The amount of SSI we pay depends on your living arrangements. Your
living arrangements are where you live, with whom you live, and how
your food and shelter expenses are paid. Based on the information we
have, your Federal living arrangement is:

Please see the enclosed "Fact Sheet on SSI Federal Living Arrangement
Categories" for a description of this Federal living arrangement
category and others.
You are living in the State of Connecticut for May 2019 on.
The amount of money we pay you from the State where you live
depends on its rules.
You are living in the State of Connecticut for June 2019 on. We
do not pay money for the State of Connecticut.
To get SSI, your countable resources must not be more than the
allowable limit of $2,000.00 for 2019 on. Your resources that we count
are $2,000.00 or less for May 2019 on. The enclosed fact sheet called
"Resources - What You Need To Know" explains how we count your
resources.
We use income to figure your eligibility and payments. By law, we use
different rules to count your income based on what kind of income you
have and when you receive it.
You had no income for May 2019 on.
We cannot pay you SSI for December 2018 through April 2019 because
you did not meet our disability rules for those months.
Information About Medicaid And Other Benefits
The application you filed with us is not an application for medical
assistance: Medicaid. If you need medical assistance or have any
questions about your eligibility for Medicaid, you should get in touch
with the Connecticut State Department of Social Services District Office.
You may want to contact your local public assistance office to find out
if you qualify for payments from them.
Basic Rules For Determining SSI Payment
The SSI amount you get may not be the same each month. It depends on the
following:
The Federal benefit rate: The Federal benefit rate is the most SSI
money the law allows us to pay. In 2019 the monthly Federal benefit
rate is $771.00.
Your living arrangements: where you live, with whom you live, and
how your living expenses are paid.
The State where you live: Some States give us money to add to SSI
payments. The amount of money we pay you from the State where you
live depends on its rules.
